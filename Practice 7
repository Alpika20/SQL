Problem 1

Consider P1(a, b) and P2(c, d) be two points on 2D plane, where (a, b) be minimum and maximum values of Northern Latitude and (c, d) be minimum and maximum 
values of Western Longitude. Write a query to print the Euclidean Distance between points P1 and P2 up to 4 decimal digits.

Hint
Euclidean distance

Definition: The straight line distance between two points. In a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) and p2 at (x2, y2), it is √((x1 - x2)² + (y1 - y2)²).


Solution
select round(sqrt(power(min(lat_n)-max(lat_n),2)+ power(min(long_w) - max(long_w),2)),4) from station 

Problem 2
A median is defined as a number separating the higher half of a data set from the lower half. 
Query the median of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION and round your answer to  decimal places.

Solution

select round(lat_n,4) from ( select row_number() over (order by lat_n asc) as rnk,lat_n from station ) a
where rnk = (select round(count(*)/2) from station)
