Problem 1
Pivot the Occupation column in OCCUPATIONS so that each Name is sorted alphabetically and displayed underneath its corresponding Occupation. The output column
headers should be Doctor, Professor, Singer, and Actor, respectively.

Note: Print NULL when there are no more names corresponding to an occupation.

Solution
select
    Doctor,
    Professor,
    Singer,
    Actor
from (
    select
        NameOrder,
        max(case Occupation when 'Doctor' then Name end) as Doctor,
        max(case Occupation when 'Professor' then Name end) as Professor,
        max(case Occupation when 'Singer' then Name end) as Singer,
        max(case Occupation when 'Actor' then Name end) as Actor
    from (
            select
                Occupation,
                Name,
                row_number() over(partition by Occupation order by Name ASC) as NameOrder
            from Occupations
         ) as NameLists
    group by NameOrder
    ) as Names
    
Problem 2:
You are given a table, BST, containing two columns: N and P, where N represents the value of a node in Binary Tree, and P is the parent of N.


Write a query to find the node type of Binary Tree ordered by the value of the node. Output one of the following for each node:

Root: If node is root node.
Leaf: If node is leaf node.
Inner: If node is neither root nor leaf node.

Solution:
select n,case when p is null then 'Root' 
when n in (select distinct P from BST) then 'Inner'
else 'Leaf' end as output from BST order by n;
