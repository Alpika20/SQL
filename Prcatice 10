Problem 1:
You are given two tables: Students and Grades. Students contains three columns ID, Name and Marks.

Grades contains the following data:grade min_marks max_marks

Ketty gives Eve a task to generate a report containing three columns:  Name, Grade and Mark. 
Ketty doesn't want the NAMES of those students who received a grade lower than 8. 
The report must be in descending order by grade -- i.e. higher grades are entered first. 
If there is more than one student with the same grade (1-10) assigned to them, order those particular students by their name alphabetically. 
Finally, if the grade is lower than 8, use "NULL" as their name and list them by their marks in ascending order.

Write a query to help Eve.

Solution:
    
select if( grade >= 8,Name,Null),grade,marks from students as s join grades as g
where s.marks between g.min_mark and g.max_mark order by grade desc,name,marks;


Problem 2
lia just finished conducting a coding contest, and she needs your help assembling the leaderboard! Write a query to print the respective hacker_id and name of
hackers who achieved full scores for more than one challenge. Order your output in descending order by the total number of challenges in which the hacker 
earned a full score. If more than one hacker received full scores in same number of challenges, then sort them by ascending hacker_id.

Solution
select s.hacker_id,h.name from hackers as h 
join submissions as s on s.hacker_id = h.hacker_id
join challenges as c on c.challenge_id = s.challenge_id
join difficulty as d on d.difficulty_level = c.difficulty_level
where s.score = d.score
group by s.hacker_id,h.name
having count(*) > 1
order by count(*) desc,hacker_id asc;
