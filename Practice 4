The CEIL() function returns the smallest integer value that is bigger than or equal to a number.

Problem 1:
Samantha was tasked with calculating the average monthly salaries for all employees in the EMPLOYEES table, but did not realize her keyboard's  key was broken until after completing the calculation. She wants your help finding the difference between her miscalculation (using salaries with any zeros removed), and the actual average salary.

Write a query calculating the amount of error (i.e.:  average monthly salaries), and round it up to the next integer.

Input Format

The EMPLOYEES table is described as follows:
+-------------+----------+
| Field       | Type     |
+-------------+----------+
| ID          | int(11)  |
| Name        | char(35) |
| Salary      | int(11)  |
+-------------+----------+



Note: Salary is per month


Solution:
select ceil(avg(salary) - avg(replace(salary, '0', ''))) from employees;


Problem 2:
We define an employee's total earnings to be their monthly  worked, and the maximum total earnings to be the maximum total earnings for
any employee in the Employee table. Write a query to find the maximum total earnings for all employees as well as the total number of employees who 
have maximum total earnings. Then print these values as  space-separated integers.

Input Format

The Employee table containing employee data for a company is described as follows:



where employee_id is an employee's ID number, name is their name, months is the total number of months they've been working for the company,
and salary is the their monthly salary.

Solution:


select MAX(salary*months), COUNT(*) from Employee where (salary * months) >= (select MAX(salary * months) from employee);
