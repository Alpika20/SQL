Problem 1:
Query the following two values from the STATION table:

The sum of all values in LAT_N rounded to a scale of  decimal places.
The sum of all values in LONG_W rounded to a scale of  decimal places.

Solution
select round(sum(lat_n),2), round(sum(long_w),2) from station


Problem 2:
Query the sum of Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION having values greater than 38.7880 and less than 137.2345 . Truncate your answer to 4 decimal places.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:

Field	Type
ID	NUMBER
CITY	VARCHAR2(21)
STATE	VARCHAR2(2)
LAT_N	NUMBER
LONG_W	NUMBER
where LAT_N is the northern latitude and LONG_W is the western longitude.

Solution

select truncate(sum(lat_n),4) from station where lat_n between 38.7880 and 137.2345;

Problem 3:
Query the greatest value of the Northern Latitudes (LAT_N) from STATION that is less than 137.2345. Truncate your answer to  decimal places.

Solution
select truncate(max(lat_n),4) from station where lat_n< 137.2345;

Problem 4
Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W) for the largest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION that is less than  137.2345. Round your answer to  decimal places.

Solution
SELECT ROUND(LONG_W,4)
FROM STATION
WHERE LAT_N = (SELECT MAX(LAT_N) FROM STATION WHERE LAT_N < 137.2345);


Problem 5
Query the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) from STATION that is greater than 38.7780 . Round your answer to  decimal places.

Solution
Query the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) from STATION that is greater than . Round your answer to  decimal places.
