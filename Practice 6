Problem 1:
Query the Western Longitude (LONG_W)where the smallest Northern Latitude (LAT_N) in STATION is greater than 38.7780. Round your answer to  decimal places.

Solution
select round(long_w,4) from station where lat_n = (select min(lat_n) from station where lat_n > 38.7780)

Problem 2:
Consider P1(a,b) and P2(c,d) to be two points on a 2D plane.

a happens to equal the minimum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).

b happens to equal the minimum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).

c happens to equal the maximum value in Northern Latitude (LAT_N in STATION).

d happens to equal the maximum value in Western Longitude (LONG_W in STATION).

Query the Manhattan Distance between points and and round it to a scale of decimal places.

Input Format

The STATION table is described as follows:

STATION Table

ID | Number
City | VarChar2(21)
State | VarChar2(2)
LAT_N | Number
LONG_W | Number

Hint: Manhattan distance: The distance between two points measured along axes at right angles. In a plane with p1 at (x1, y1) 
and p2 at (x2, y2), it is |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|.

Solution:
select round((max(lat_n)-min(lat_n)),4)+round((max(long_w)-min(long_w)),4)
from station;
